# Game-of-chance

This game is similar to Yahtzee! I play a game of chance. I have three fair dices. I throw them simultaneously. If all the numbers are same e.g. 111 or 666 then I win, I get 25 dollars and I stop playing. However if numbers are not same then I can throw any number of dices (1,2,3) simultaneously again to get the maximum payoff which is the sum of all the three numbers or I can just stop and keep the current payoff. What should be my optimal strategy to get the maximum payoff.
